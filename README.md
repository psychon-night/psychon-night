## About me
ðŸ‘‹ I'm Psychon. I'm a high-school, tech-oriented student. I'm in love with basically everything technology... except Apple. 
I use they/them pronouns.
I'm also a fabrication student in FRC Team 2910 (bow to Alphonso).

There are a few ways to contact me:
- Leave an issue (or something) on my psychon-night repository (I don't use it for anything, so go right ahead. Just don't spam me, please.)
- Email me at PsychonNight@outlook.com (also, please don't spam me here either)

## Links and stuff
You're going to harrass me anyways, might as well give them to you.
