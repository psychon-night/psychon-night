## About
ðŸ‘‹ I'm Psychon. I'm a high-school, tech-oriented student. I'm in love with basically everything technology... except Apple.\
I use **she/her** pronouns.\
I'm also a fabrication student in FRC Team 2910 (bow to Alphonso).

There are a few ways to contact me:
- Leave an issue (or something) on my psychon-night repository (I don't use it for anything, so go right ahead. Just don't spam me, please.)
- Email me at PsychonNight@outlook.com (also, please don't spam me here either)
