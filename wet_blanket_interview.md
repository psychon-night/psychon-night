**Anything else we should know?**
Oh, yeah, a whole bunch of stuff, actually. Not going to tell you all of it, but I will list a few fun facts.
- I correct people's spelling and grammar. A _lot_.
- Some of my obsessiveness stems from my ADHD
- You'll probably befriend me easily, as long as you're not an a- ~~oh, I can't say that? Darn it~~ complete jerk to me or my friends. Or other people.
- If you're homophobic, transphobic, or against any of my fellow LGBTQ+ or Furry friends, you can _leave_. Like, _right now_, and never speak to me again. I'm dead serious, I will not tolerate it.
- Be a good person or you will quickly regret it
